# Theatre Travels
My second milestone project is a website for a small travel agency
that specializes in short trips to European capitals for theatre enthusiasts.

The deployed website can be found [here](https://sarani1612.github.io/milestone-project-2/).

## UX
What sets this travel agency apart from many others out there is its focus on giving people a cultural experience
they will remember for many years by including a trip to the theatre in all their travel packages.
In addition, they make sure to pick hotels and restaurants of a high standard in order to create an all-round feeling of glamour and luxury.

I felt it would be important for the customers to get this feeling already from their first visit to the website.
I therefore chose a simple design without any clutter or clashing colours, and I chose a colour scheme
and images that were meant to convey the sense of a tranquil, magical sunset,
given that that would typically be around the time of day where you would be heading to the theatre.

### User Stories
- as a first time user of the website, I can easily move through the sections without too much clicking.
- as a firs time user of the website, I can quickly get a sense of what the business is about and what they offer.
- as a potential customer, I can easily locate the business' social media profiles where I will be able to get more information and read reviews.
- as a returning customer, I can quickly get in touch with the business to discuss my next vacation without necessarily having to go through the other sections.

### Wireframes
See the wireframes I created for this website by clicking on the links below.

Each file contains 4 views: view 1 is the landing page, view 2 is the Destinations section with the city images
while view 3 is one of the modals that pop up when an image is clicked. View 4 is what I imagined the Contact section would look like.

The wireframes were created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Features
The website is a one-page site where the user can scroll down from the **landing-page** to the **Destinations** section
and further on to the **Contact** section.\
There is a navigation bar which stays fixed at the top when scrolling and a footer at the bottom of the Contact section.

### Landing-page
The landing-page consist of a background photo of an easily recognizagle, popular holiday destination, London.
Over the photo is the name of the business and a very brief text explaining what the business is about.\
The landing-page covers the full viewport and is kept minimalistic and simple to avoid information overload.

### Destinations section
This bulk of this section is 9 photos of the destinations that the business offers. Since these photos are really what is important here,
the background is a soft gradient with no figures, shapes and so on.\
At the top, there is a paragraph inviting users to click on the photos in order to see more information about the trip.\
There is also a friendly paragraph encouraging users to contact the business.\
Clicking on each of the photos opens up a modal with a map and a description of the destination.
The modal content has the same soft gradient background as the Destinations section itself to tie it all together.

### Contact Section
The contact section uses the same background photo as the landing-page, again to tie it all together.
Here, however, it has been toned down with an overlay to make the contact form stand out and easier to read.\
The form itself has input fields for name, email address, travel dates, duration and comments. It is followed by a submit button.\
Finally, at the bottom there is a footer with copyright info and links to social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest).

### Existing Features
- **Colour scheme:** As mentioned above in the introduction, a colour scheme reminiscent of a sunset was used for this website.
The main colour is a vivid orange, and it is used for the business name heading, header, footer and the text in the **contact** section.
A complementary dark purplish blue colour is used for text and icons in the header and footer, the submit button and for image borders in the **destinations** section.
A darker shade of the blue color is used as a hover over colour for the links, icons, button and image borders. An even darker, almost black, shade was used for longer texts in the **destinations** section and the modals since this is easier on the eyes.\
The orange colour was also used as a partially transparent background to the sub-heading on the landing-page, and the text itself differs from other text on the website in that it is white.
This was done to increase the contrast ratio between text and background in order to make it easier to read.
- **Photos:** All the photos for the holiday destinations show the cities during a sunset which ties in with the colour scheme and adds to the overall theme of the website.
- **Navigation bar:** The website has a navigation bar with the business name and links to all sections on the site. It is fixed to the top so that it always stays within view.
This is important given that it is a one-page website and a lot of scrolling would be required otherwise. This way the user can navigate easily between the sections at all times.
- **Footer:** The website has a footer with copyright info and with links to social media where the user would be able to find additional info and reviews.
The footer stays at the bottom of the page and is only visible when scrolling down.
- **Animations:** 
- **Modals:**
