# Theatre Travels
My second milestone project is a website for a small travel agency
that specializes in short trips to European capitals for theatre enthusiasts.

The deployed website can be found [here](https://sarani1612.github.io/milestone-project-2/).

## UX


### Wireframes

See the wireframes I created for this website by clicking on the links below.

Each file contains 4 views: view 1 is the landingpage, view 2 is the Destinations section with the city images
while view 3 is one of the modals that pop up when an image is clicked. View 4 is what I imagined the Contact section would look like.
