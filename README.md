# Theatre Travels
My second milestone project is a website for a small travel agency
that specializes in short trips to European capitals for theatre enthusiasts.

The deployed website can be found [here](https://sarani1612.github.io/milestone-project-2/).

## UX
What sets this travel agency apart from many others out there is its focus on giving people a cultural experience
they will remember for many years by including a trip to the theatre in all their travel packages.
In addition, they make sure to pick hotels and restaurants of a high standard in order to create an all-round feeling of glamour and luxury.

I felt it would be important for the customers to get this feeling already from their first visit to the website.
I therefore chose a simple design without any clutter or clashing colours, and I chose a colour scheme
and images that were meant to convey the sense of a tranquil, magical sunset,
given that that would typically be around the time of day where you would be heading to the theatre.

### User Stories
- as a first time user of the website, I can easily move through the sections without too much clicking.
- as a firs time user of the website, I can quickly get a sense of what the business is about and what they offer.
- as a potential customer, I can easily locate the business' social media profiles where I will be able to get more information and read reviews.
- as a returning customer, I can quickly get in touch with the business to discuss my next vacation without necessarily having to go through the other sections.

### Wireframes
See the wireframes I created for this website by clicking on the links below.

Each file contains 4 views: view 1 is the landing page, view 2 is the Destinations section with the city images
while view 3 is one of the modals that pop up when an image is clicked. View 4 is what I imagined the Contact section would look like.
